# Project Overview

## Vision

Link aims to transform how people in low resource settings access healthcare. By combining AI‑powered triage, smart recommendations and secure digital records, Link helps patients navigate healthcare systems with confidence while giving providers tools to manage appointments and patient data more efficiently.

## Functional Modules

### Symptom Checker (AI‑Guided Triage)

- **One‑question‑at‑a‑time flow**: Users answer questions sequentially, minimizing cognitive load.  
- **Age‑ and condition‑aware logic**: The triage algorithm adjusts its questioning based on the patient’s age, sex and known conditions.  
- **AI‑generated summary**: A concise summary of the user’s symptoms is generated along with a recommendation (self‑care, clinic visit or emergency).  
- **Outcome mapping**: Determines the suggested level of care.

### Smart Facility Recommendations

- **Location‑based**: Recommends facilities based on proximity to the user and triage results.  
- **Facility details**: Provides open hours, services offered, queue times, available equipment and payment or voucher status (e.g., TeleBirr).  
- **Status flags**: Inactive or closed facilities are clearly flagged.

### Personal Health Records (PHR)

- **Dashboard**: Lists the patient’s triage history, uploaded documents, visit notes and medications.  
- **Export/Share**: Records can be exported or shared via PDF or QR code.  
- **Patient ownership**: Patients own and control their records, ensuring privacy and consent.

### Appointment Booking

- **Flexible booking**: Enables in‑person or virtual appointment scheduling with facilities or providers.  
- **Reminders**: Sends confirmations and reminders.  
- **Shared context**: Providers receive the patient’s triage summary and uploaded documents ahead of the appointment.

### Provider Portal

- **Appointment management**: Providers can view and manage appointments.  
- **Encounter notes**: Supports recording diagnoses, treatments and follow‑up plans.  
- **Clinic management**: Tools for managing clinic details, staff and equipment.

### Health Feed

- **Community Q&A**: Patients can ask anonymous questions.  
- **Educational content**: Providers and sponsors can post articles or videos.  
- **Engagement**: Features up‑voting, reputation badges and content moderation.

### Preventive Prompts & Challenges

- **Personalized nudges**: Sends timely reminders for preventive care based on patient data.  
- **Challenges**: Sponsor‑funded health challenges (e.g., blood pressure checks) with rewards like airtime or pharmacy vouchers.

### Privacy & Consent

- **Anonymous by default**: Users do not need to reveal their identity.  
- **Explicit sharing**: Patients decide when and with whom to share data.  
- **Data ownership**: Patients remain the owners of their health records.
